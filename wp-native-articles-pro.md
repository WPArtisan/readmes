Easy Facebook Instant Articles Plugin for your WordPress site with better content parsing and advanced features.

== Description ==

**Major Updates**

- 1.2.5 - Specify different content for your Instant Article
- 1.2.2 - WP Bakery Visual Composer Support

A better implementation of Facebook Instant Articles for WordPress.

Only available in the Facebook mobile app, Instant Articles are a pre-loaded, super fast, and optimized version of your regular articles. Boasting some impressive stats (10x faster, 20% more reads, 70% less abandonment) they have quickly become a must for every publisher.

**How it works**

After installation and setup this plugin auto generates an instant article version for each of your WordPress articles. The article's regular HTML is parsed and converted to correct Facebook Instant Article markup which is then submitted to Facebook via an RSS feed. Anytime your article is then viewed using the Facebook mobile app it will load the pre-cached, super fast, optimized version. When the article is shared or posted its instant status will also be denoted by the lightning symbol in the corner.

[Read more about Instant Articles from the official documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instant-articles)

**Content Parsing**

A large part of the complexity of integrating Facebook Instant Articles is the rigorous content structure imposed. Due to the WYSIWYG editor and the plethora of plugins and themes available, WordPress content tends to be rather unstructured. Most of the current Facebook Instant Article plugins don't really take account of this and either produce invalid content or strip parts out. This plugin is a concentrated effort to correctly format any WordPress content it could possibly come across. You can read more about the challenges and solutions faced when parsing unstructured content on our [Instant Articles blog](https://wp-native-articles.com/blog/formatting-wordpress-html-content-instant-articles/?utm_source=fplugin&utm_medium=readme).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I find the support documentation? =

All documentation is available at [docs.wp-native-articles.com](http://docs.wp-native-articles.com). It is a work in progress so please bear with us.

= Does it support Branded Content? =

Yes. Individual articles can be setup as branded. The author details are used and displayed on the Instant Article.

= Does it support Ads & Analytics? =

Yes. Both can be added on a global level or overridden for individual articles.

= I use ACF or Meta Fields to display some content. Are these supported? =

They won't automatically be added to the Instant Articles unfortunately. However, they should be easy enough to add as
not only are there hooks galore in the plugin but the Instant Article templates can be overridden in your own theme or plugin.

= Does it play well with other plugins? =

Yes, extremely well. We've tested loads of popular plugins that embed content and built in support for Yoast, Co-Authors-Plus, Visual Bakery and Playbuzz to name a few.
If you find any that don't work or that we've missed please let us know and we'll be sure to fix them.

= Is there a road map? =

Yep. It can be found on our [instant articles roadmap page](https://wp-native-articles.com/roadmap/?utm_source=fplugin&utm_medium=readme-d).

= Does it support WordPress Multisite? =

Yes it does. There's a management panel in the Network Admin sidebar menu.
It can be used to copy settings from one blog to another and set a default blog
to inherit settings from when new blogs are created.

= Does it support custom post types? =

Yes. The RSS feeds defaults to posts but custom post types can be specified by pass in query parameters. More information can be [found here](http://docs.wp-native-articles.com/article/44-custom-post-types)

= Is it multilingual compatible? =

Yes. All text strings use the WordPress i18n translation functions. If you'd like to help translate the plugin we'd love to hear from you!

= Does it work for multi-language sites? =

Yes. If you're using the WPML plugin it will generate a combined feed of all languages by default or you can pass in query parameters to specify which languages you'd like.

= What's the minimum PHP version required? =

It has the same requirements as WordPress, so PHP >= 5.2.4.

= I've found a bug? I have a feature request? =

Excellent. We'd love to hear from you. All support for the free plugin is done
through the WordPress support forum found on the Plugin download page.
